# MoCapTrajectory
A repo for mapping MoCap data to robotic actuators

This is ongoing project to map data recorded from human activity to robotic actuators in order to transfer the human skills to the robotic platforms.

For now we only implemented utilities to represent the rotation `(x,y,z)` positions of the human joints to quaternion space which is more relaiable and efficient 
for computation cost and time consumption..

Soon we will provide data preprocessing, models, trainers and testers for all proposed models that we will adopt in this work.
